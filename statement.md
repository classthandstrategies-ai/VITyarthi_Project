Project Statement: 
VITyarthi Academic Planner

Problem Statement
Let’s face it, university life means juggling endless assignments, projects, and exams. Most students try to manage everything with paper planners or basic to-do lists, but those tools don’t really help once you’re dealing with lots of deadlines, subjects, and shifting priorities. It’s easy to lose track, miss a submission, or just get overwhelmed.

Scope of the Project
The VITyarthi Academic Planner steps in as a Python-based console app built to bring order to the chaos. Here’s what it covers:

- You get a digital space to store every task.
- You can sort tasks by subject and how important they are.
- You’ll always know what’s done and what’s still hanging over your head.
- And your progress sticks around—even after you close the app.

Target Users
- University students at VIT who have to keep up with non-stop assessments.
- Teaching assistants who want to keep tabs on grading and other tasks.

High-Level Features
- Task Management: Add, edit, and delete your academic tasks as things change.
- Categorisation: Tag stuff as high, medium, or low priority.
- Persistence: The app saves everything automatically using a JSON file, so you don’t lose your work.
- Analytics: Quickly see what’s still pending and what you’ve finished.
- Error Handling: The app won’t crash just because you typed the wrong thing by mistake.
